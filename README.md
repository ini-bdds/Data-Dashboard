Data Analytics Dashboard
=============
The Data Analytics Dashboard is an integrated Big-Data analytics suite designed for web based merging, integration, and analysis of large, incongruent datasets. The package features a non-relational database for storage and integration of heterogeneous datasets, a JavaScript-based web server built using node.js, and a sleek front-end for visualization and real-time manipulation of data.
